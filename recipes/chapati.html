    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup whole wheat flour</li>
        <li>Evaporated milk</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Â¾ cup hot water or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, and salt in a large bowl. Use a wooden
            spoon to stir in water and oil. Mix until a soft, elastic dough forms and add more
            water, if needed. Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth.
        </li>
        <li>Divide dough into 10 equal portions, or less if you want larger chapatis. Roll
            each piece into a ball and let rest for a few minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Heat a lightly greased skillet over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Use a rolling pin to roll dough balls out on a lightly floured surface until very thin.</li>
        <li>When the skillet starts to smoke, place a chapati in it. Cook until bottom has
            brown spots, about 30 seconds, then flip and cook 30 seconds more. 
            Repeat to cook remaining chapatis.
        </li>
    </ol>
